    <p>To better understand disease, scholars reviewing the coronavirus pandemic have initiated a movement around the world to map and trace the network of disease across the globe. These visualizations have helped bring new perspectives to scholarly ideas regarding disease and their mobility. The goal of this project is to document the mobility of disease networks in the late Ottoman Empire of the 19th century. By visualizing the origins of pandemics like cholera, plague and animal diseases, this project aims to contribute to the growing body of health and medicinal history in the Ottoman Empire and its extent in the Middle East.
    </p>
    <p>This project aims to visualize archival data about diseases in the Ottoman Empire to interactive web maps. Often in archival research, documents provide historians with information only in textual format. The benefit of visualizing historical data is that connections between information within documents have better spatial clarity. While documents themselves may contain references to larger trends, these become more easily visible when using GIS applications and visualization tools. In the case of Ottoman archival documents related to disease, the reports refer more to the number of outbreaks rather than to the mobility aspect of the diseases. Through information researched about important trade routes and nodes of activity, historians can help to shed light on the mobility of disease in the Ottoman Empire in the late 19th century. Our understanding of the ranges in contemporary transportation as well as a modern understanding of disease spread can help to shed light on the connected nature of diseases in the past. The focus of this project will be on pinpointing cholera, plague, and animal diseases as these have better recording as well as known mobility throughout the empire. The data is collected by reading through the Ottoman archives and detailing this information from the document. As most documents provide an accurate date as well as information on the type of breakout, this will first be used to map the places at which diseases were confirmed. An analysis of the data based on distance as well as differences in date-time will be used to determine whether any outbreaks had connection to one another. The resulting project will be a time lapse of the points and magnitudes at which diseases are recorded as well as visualizing any of the connections between instances through potential logistical routes.</p>
